what it does / should do:


Create package task
	- write up how this part works in the readme

	- do the folder packaging (rather than project packaging so far)
		- local
		- remote
		- write it up in readme


find out how to change the path the zip folder creates:

c:\users\jon.redriver\documents\visual studio 2010\Projects\MvcApplication2>msbuild MvcApplication2\MvcApplication2.csproj /target:clean /target:package /p:_PackageTempDir=C:\Package /p:PackageLocation=C:\temp\mvctesting\mytest.zip

this cleans
packages it
the packatetempdir changes the path within the zip file
packagelocation changes the output location of the zip file



Add to readme:
ziping a folder structure and sending to remote server (doesnt explode on other end):
"C:\Program Files\IIS\Microsoft Web Deploy\msdeploy.exe" -source:iisApp='D:\Work\Lumicom\MembersApplication' -dest:package="C:\websites\aa\membersapplication.zip",computername='107.21.229.99:8173',username='Administrator',password="p;L=&?q2QE" -verb:sync




optional console param to set the executing folder to be the same as the exe's folder



create task to copy a zip package / folder to a remote server then unzip the folder.
	this will need to have a number of steps
		check zip file exists
			copy zip to remote server
		if not check its a folder
			if folder zip it and send to server
		
		if neither of above throw error

		allow user to provide a destination path, if none given use the destination path given inside the zip, (for local the destination folder must already exist).

			this could be done by checking the config first
			if nothing given check the zip file and find the full path (including drive) given

			explode zip to path.

		will probably need a working dir to do the exploding to analysis path.








installer app - handler to set folder permissions for a given path..
	Values like:

	Path
	Permission , read, write, etc
	People to be given permission
	Inheritable?





exe action component stuff


Create some examples with config files.



future ideas:

- only do an update if there is a difference on the destination machine.
	if you have the config you want setup check to see if all settings are the same.  could do this with dump destination server settings and check files are identical.

- do iisreset, start stop commands etc on local or remote server

- have command to be able to auto backup current website or vdir when doing a deploy, would rename folder to some backup name (date or something specified)
