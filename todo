what it does / should do:

create local and remote website installers
create config entries to test
update documentation.

create local and remote website removers
create config entries to test
update documentation.

Create same folder with config files.



future ideas:

- only do an update if there is a difference on the destination machine.
	if you have the config you want setup check to see if all settings are the same.  could do this with dump destination server settings and check files are identical.

- do iisreset, start stop commands etc on local or remote server

- have command to be able to auto backup current website or vdir when doing a deploy, would rename folder to some backup name (date or something specified)
