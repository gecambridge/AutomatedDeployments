/client app-iisbackup:

want viewmodel for global (main page)
	then one for app pool, website and vdirs
	commands to load each viewmodel
	command to export the whole IIS

	viewmodel base:
		notify property changed
		refresh data, (clear all cache and reload data)

	app pools:
		list apppools
		selected app pool
		list of websites owned by that appPool
		command to:
			export app pool(s)
			view selected website(s)






- be able to interrogate the local machine to see what appPools, websites and Vdirs are setup currently
	be able to create script / backup files of those settings
		needs to be able to say well this website uses this app pool and has these vdirs, do you want it all?

- copy files to a local or remote machine

- check if apppool, website or vdir are setup locally or remotely
	first task is to see if those names exist
	secondly if you have the config you want setup check to see if all settings are the same.  could do this with dump destination server settings and check files are identical.

- have command to be able to auto backup current website or vdir when doing a deploy, would rename folder to some backup name (date or something specified)

- do iisreset, start stop commands etc on local or remote server

- deploy apppool, website or vdir to local or remote server

- be able to script all of these commands easily and fluently
